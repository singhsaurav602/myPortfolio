<h3>Naruto : Shippuden</h3>
<p>This was the first anime i ever saw and loved the characters except may be Sakura Lol.</p>

<h3>Attack on Titans</h3>
<p>Quite Violent for my likes but certainly loved the story.</p>

<h3>Vinland Saga</h3>
<p>Awesome Animation and visuals. Mixture of emotion is just nerve racking</p>
